I am an associate professor of the practice of computing and data sciences in the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences at Boston University.
I am also affiliated with and teach for the Computer Science department here too.

I teach a variety of classes in data science and computer science with a bias towards algorithmically oriented subjects.
My recent research has been in game solving (classical AI) and fundamental methods.
