I am an associate professor of the practice of computing and data sciences in the [Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences](//www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/) at [Boston University](//www.bu.edu).
I am also affiliated with and teach for the [Computer Science department](//www.bu.edu/cs/).

I teach a variety of classes in data science and computer science with a bias towards algorithmically oriented subjects.
I also have been intimately involved in the launch of our [online Master's of Data Science](//www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/programs-admissions/online-msds/) program where I designed both first semester academic modules.
My recent research has been in game solving (classical AI) and fundamental methods.

Previously, I worked in industry for about twenty years, mostly incubating and building web-based startups and data science platforms to drive them.
I spent fifteen years at [Cogo Labs](//www.cogolabs.com) (originally Adverplex) where we successfully exited CourseAdvisor ([acquired by the Washington Post](//www.jayweintraub.com/2007/10/online-edu-comp.html)), Autotegrity ([acquired by ADP](https://digitaldealer.com/everyone/adp-digital-marketing-building-cambridge-analytics-center-autotegrity-acquired-as-nucleus-of-new-facility-for-optimizing-online-consumer-experiences/)), and Everquote ([went public as $EVER](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EVER/)).
Later, I served as CTO at [Solved Home](https://solvedhome.com) where I remain on the board.
